# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX allows us to implement Javascript within HTML using component. The syntax difference comes from the curly braces implemented within the HTML that allows us to call upon Javascript functions.

Researched answer: JavaScript Syntac Extension is an extension that allows you to write similar javascript code similar to HTML. Curly braces are used to pass values as props to the component in HTML. <></> fragment tags is a way to list a group of children elements without adding extra nodes to DOM. Fragments allow you to return multiple elements from a component without needing to wrap them in a parent element.

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: I would have to go back and research further what yarn is specifically, but I do know that yarn installs packages called yarn.lock and packages.json and it's necessary to install when working with multiple files or folder for the same project.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for Javascript that was developed by Facebook. It allows you to manage and install packages of reusable code that is used in Javascript. A major feature of Yarn is its ability to download and install packages at the same time. Another feature of Yarns is the workspaces feature. This allows you to manage multiple different packages in a sigle repository which can then be published together.

3. What is a React component? 

Your answer: React component uses Javascript that can be exported and imported into different locations including HTML and are called upon when using the correct Javascript syntax. As a new devoloper I haven't worked with components enough to fully understand the ins and outs of components and their html and css implications. When the interview is finished would you mind giving me research tips so I can better understand components?

Researched answer: A component is a modular, reusable piece of code that wraps a specific functionality. They can be a class or function component. Class components use ES6 classes. ES6 classes are more complex. They're designed to be used in multiple places throughout an application. React components use JSX syntax.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State uses hooks. Props stands for properties and acts like parameters. I can't elaborate fully on states and props as I don't have a full understanding of them yet. I would have to do more research on them. Would you mind pointing me in the right direction for further learning them as well as react components?

Researched answer: State is an internal data of component that can be changed and updated. state is managed using 'useState' which is a hook. it allows components to store and update data within their scope. Props are the data that's passed into a component from the parent component. props cannot be modified within the component. They are strings. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is everything that is interactable with a user. Like clicking a button, hyperlink, inputing text.

Researched answer: DOM is a tree structure of the represented html elements in a webpage or app. DOM is the User interface of the application. It allows developers to modify content using Javascript. 


6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: A div tag divides code within a code block allowing to call multiple different related elements to perform a specific outcome. I would need to research what a span tag is, but I think it operates similarly to a div tag spanning the entire command.

Researched answer: A div tag is used to divide a section of the web page. it's a container element to group related elements and implements the styling of that element. When used with css div tags can be styled to create visuals on a web page.
Span tags create an inline text container. IT IS similar to div, but it's used to apply specific stylings to individual portions of text.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: OOP is programming model that uses object to represent and change data and its behaviour. It organizes around data, and objects rather than functions and logic.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a high level, general purpose programming language created by Yukihiro Matz. It's a language where code is executed without the need for compilation. Everything in ruby is an object. Ruby is typically used with Ruby on Rails.

3. Implicit return: Implicit return allows us to return values without using the return keyword. When creating an implicit return, you can just use the variable and then parentheses. const('implicit returns') -- which returns whatever string you've implemented.

4. Ruby blocks: A Ruby block can be passed as an argument to a method. block are defined using curly braces, 'do' or 'end' keywords. 

5. Ruby hashes: In Ruby a hash is a collection of key-value pairs
